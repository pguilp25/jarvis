"""Native (structured) tool-calling coder path — 2026-05-27.

JARVIS's default coder loop is TEXT-based: the model emits `[tool use]` / `[edit:N]`
as plain text the runtime regex-parses. Models trained primarily for NATIVE
function calling (gpt-oss-120b — the most redundant free model: Groq, OpenRouter,
DeepInfra, NIM) don't speak that idiom; they emit bare tags. This module gives
them a real OpenAI function-calling loop instead.

PARITY: the native coder exposes the SAME capabilities as the text coder — not a
reduced set. Each text tool maps to one native tool, reusing the text coder's
exact executor so behaviour is identical:

    text tag            native tool        executor (core.tool_call)
    ─────────────────   ────────────────   ─────────────────────────────
    [CODE:]/[VIEW:]     read_file          _run_code_reads (skeleton+expand)

    [DEPENDSON:]        depends_on         exploration_tools.extract_dependencies
    [REPLACE LINES]     replace_lines      _extract/_apply_extracted_code
    [DONE]              finish             —

INDENT FORMAT (ckpt 125/129; gutter naturalized ckpt 143): read_file + the pre-loaded file
block render each line as `LINENO ⇥INDENT|<real spaces>code` (prefix_ws) — line# bare on the
left, `⇥INDENT` marks the indent number, then real spaces + code. The coder SEES the
indentation AND its number. Edits declare indent by NUMBER: old/new lines are `INDENT|code`
and the applier (`_expand_indent_lines`) re-emits the spaces — so the coder states a number
and never types (or drops) leading spaces (the col-0 dedent root cause). STRICT (ckpt 129):
the applier transforms ONLY the two UNAMBIGUOUS forms — `INDENT|code` and a full view line
`LINENO ⇥INDENT|code` (also tolerating the old `LINENO:INDENT|`, plus stripping the harness's
own `|appears N (#hex)` tail). A diff
row is NOT editable input (its gutter is shape-ambiguous with YAML/config, so it's taken
literally and the reject tells the coder to re-send as `INDENT|code`). Anything else is
literal — no guessed transform can corrupt real content.

Primary edit = `edit_file(path, hunks)` (content-anchored, can't go stale); `replace_lines`
is the secondary line-range tool. Both REUSE the existing applier + validation gate +
reject feedback (lazy import, to avoid a circular dep with workflows.code). The coder also
has `run_code` (a sandboxed runner — read-only, no network).
